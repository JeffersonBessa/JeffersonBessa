## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jefferson, a Experienced QA Engineer, working for the last 8 years with software quality assurance focused on test automation, with background in several levels of software testing such as:  Functional or Black-Box Testing on REST APIs - Back-End (API Testing) and on Front-End Applications (Web Interface Testing/UI Testing), Non-Functional or Load Testing (Performance Testing), Exploratory Tests, Smoke Tests and Regression Tests. During my carrer, I've been working with large-scale web applications, microservices and APIs, in highly critical and robust environments, with millions of active users in the areas of core banking, payments, investments, risks and regulatory for the financial sector, as well as for tax and financial administration for the government sector. 
Well-versed in both, manual and automation testing and knowledge of working with CI/CD pipelines.
